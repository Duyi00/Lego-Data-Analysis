# Lego-Data-Analysis
Welcome to a personal project of mine! This project was actually insipired by Keith Galli. His YouTube video documenting his approach can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzQDi4D0B_M&t=2258s">here</a>. This GitHub repository is a take on my approach on the questions he posed. Feel free to take a look. Any constructive feedback is welcomed!

Our problem today focuses more on **data cleaning**. Using `Pandas` and `NumPy`, we aim to answer the following 2 questions and one bonus:
- What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed?¶
- In which year was Star Wars NOT the most popular licensed theme (in terms of sets released that year)?
- **(BONUS)** How many sets did Lego produce each year?¶

I have also attempted to use `Matplotlib` as well as `Seaborn` to incopertate some visualisation in my data cleaning process.
